# Decision log

Short records of choices that are not obvious from reading the code, so the
reasoning survives past the day it was made. Format: context → decision →
consequence. A decision that later turns out wrong is superseded here, not
silently edited.

## ADR-001 — One PostgreSQL instance for business data, vectors and audit log

**Date:** D0 · **Status:** accepted

**Context.** The system needs relational business tables (for the SQL tool),
document chunks with embeddings (for the retrieval tool), and an audit trail. The
obvious alternative is a dedicated vector database (Qdrant, Weaviate) next to
PostgreSQL.

**Decision.** Use a single PostgreSQL 17 instance with the `pgvector` extension
for all three.

**Why.** Two reasons, in order of weight:

1. **Access control stays in one place.** Row-level scoping for SQL results and
   document chunks is enforced by the same `WHERE` clauses against the same
   session. With a separate vector store, the document side would need its own
   filter implementation, and two implementations of one security rule is how
   isolation bugs happen.
2. Fewer moving parts for a demo that must start with one command.

**Consequence.** Approximate-nearest-neighbour tuning options are narrower than a
dedicated vector DB. At a few hundred chunks this is irrelevant — exact search is
fast enough, and an honest "exact search, corpus is small" beats an untuned HNSW
index. Revisit only if measured latency says so.

## ADR-002 — LLM and embedding provider deliberately unset on D0

**Date:** D0 · **Status:** open, decide on D2

**Context.** Generation and embeddings both need a provider. Anthropic has no
embedding API; OpenAI and Google have both generation and embeddings; local
`sentence-transformers` embeddings are free but pull in torch (a large download).

**Decision.** `LLM_PROVIDER`, `LLM_MODEL` and `EMBEDDING_BACKEND` default to
`unset`/`local` and are read from the environment. No provider SDK is a hard
dependency yet; the `embed` and `eval` extras stay optional.

**Why.** Committing the skeleton to one vendor before the eval harness exists
would make the first measurement a vendor comparison instead of a baseline.

**Consequence.** D2 must pick one and record the exact model name and date in
`docs/report.md`, because model behaviour changes over time and a number without
a model name cannot be reproduced.

## ADR-003 — The eval set and the evidence files are committed; data and models are not

**Date:** D0 · **Status:** accepted

**Context.** `.gitignore` normally excludes data. But the evaluation questions are
ground truth written by hand, and every number in the README comes from a
specific run.

**Decision.** Commit `eval/` (questions and expected answers) and `evidence/`
(raw run outputs). Keep `data/raw/`, `models/`, `mlruns/` out.

**Why.** A claimed metric that cannot be traced to a file is not evidence. The
eval set is also the artefact that makes a retrieval change comparable across
days; versioning it in git (and with DVC once it grows) is what makes
"recall went from A to B" a statement about the system rather than about the
dataset.

**Consequence.** The eval set is visible to anyone reading the repo. That is
intended — it invites the reader to judge whether the questions are fair.

---

## ADR-004 — Liveness and readiness are separate endpoints

**Date:** D0 · **Status:** accepted

**Context.** A container healthcheck that calls the database will fail the
container when the database is briefly unavailable, and the orchestrator will
restart a process that was working fine.

**Decision.** `/health` reports only that the process is up and makes no
dependency calls. `/ready` checks PostgreSQL and returns 503 when it is
unreachable. The Docker `HEALTHCHECK` uses `/health`.

**Consequence.** A database outage makes the service not-ready (so traffic can be
withheld) without triggering a restart loop.

## ADR-005 — Database host defaults to `127.0.0.1`, never `localhost`

**Date:** D0 · **Status:** accepted, cause established by measurement

> **Correction.** The first version of this record blamed "the IPv6 attempt
> stalls", citing a `Test-NetConnection ::1` probe. That probe was unreliable (it
> returned `NotConnected` in 0.02s, which is not a connect result), and the
> explanation was wrong. The measurements below replace it.

**Context.** The integration test did not finish instead of failing fast.
Reproduced deliberately afterwards: with `POSTGRES_HOST=localhost` the same test
still does not finish within 240s; with `127.0.0.1` it passes in 0.44s.

**What was measured.**

| Probe | Result |
|---|---|
| `socket.getaddrinfo("localhost", 5433)` | returns `AF_INET6 ::1` **first**, then `AF_INET 127.0.0.1` |
| `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5433 -State Listen` | one listener, `127.0.0.1` only — nothing on `[::1]` |
| raw Python `connect(("::1", 5433))` | `ConnectionRefusedError` after **2.04s** — refused, but not promptly |
| raw Python `connect(("127.0.0.1", 5433))` | connected in **0.000s** |
| `psycopg.connect(...@localhost...?connect_timeout=5)` | **succeeds in 5.08s** — exactly the timeout |
| `psycopg.connect(...@127.0.0.1...)` | succeeds in **0.04s** |

**Cause.** Three things compose into one slow path:

1. `localhost` is a name, and on this host it resolves IPv6-first.
2. Compose publishes the port as `127.0.0.1:5433:5432`, so `[::1]:5433` has no
   listener.
3. libpq tries resolved addresses **in order**, and `connect_timeout` is applied
   **per address**. The `::1` attempt is not rejected promptly here (~2s raw), so
   every new connection pays that cost before falling back to IPv4 — and with
   `connect_timeout=5` it burns the full 5s rather than the 2s, proving the wait
   is bounded by the timeout, not by the refusal.

**Still not explained.** A per-connection penalty of a few seconds does not by
itself account for a test that runs past 240s over two connections. The remaining
multiplier has not been isolated. What is established is the direction — the name
`localhost` costs seconds per connection and the literal IPv4 address costs
nothing — and that is enough to justify the decision.

**Decision.** Default `POSTGRES_HOST` to `127.0.0.1` in both `src/config.py` and
`.env.example`. Keep the explicit IPv4 binding in compose: binding to all
interfaces would hide this and would also expose the database beyond the host.

**Consequence and the general lesson.** The connection string carries no
`connect_timeout`, so a connection that cannot be made waits instead of failing.
**A missing timeout converts a fast error into an unbounded wait** — the same
property that makes timeouts a design concern for every outbound call in this
system, not a tuning detail.
